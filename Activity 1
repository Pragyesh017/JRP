DNS
DNS stands for Domain Name System, which is a system that translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses: 
DNS allows users to access websites by inputting domain names like "example.com" into their browsers, instead of having to remember the IP address for each website. 
DNS servers are built into most modern operating systems and work with DNS clients to enable web browsers to interact with them. When a user requests a website, the DNS server checks its cache for the IP address, and if it can't find it, it sends a request to other servers

SSH (Secure Shell)
An SSH key pair is a set of two keys that are used to authenticate a user or process that wants to access a remote system using the SSH (secure shell) protocol:
Public key
Used to encrypt messages that can only be decrypted by the private key. The public key is shared with the remote server and can be stored in a public key file on the server.
Private key
Used to decrypt messages and should be kept secret. The private key is stored on the system being used to access the remote server.
