Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model where software applications are delivered over the internet. Instead of installing and maintaining software on individual devices, users access these applications via a web browser, with the service provider handling maintenance, updates, and security. This model offers scalability, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility from any internet-connected device.
